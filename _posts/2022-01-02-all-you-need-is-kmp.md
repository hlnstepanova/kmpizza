What is Kotlin Multiplatform? In short, it's the future of mobile development. You donâ€™t believe me? Let me try to persuade you: Kotlin Multiplatform is still young, but itâ€™s a very promising technology. It allows developers to share parts of code between different platforms, whether it's your backend, or an iOS app, or an Android app, or even a web or desktop. Kotlin will find its way anywhere. 
 
Itâ€™s particularly great for mobile developers, because it can help us leverage the best of Kotlin to quickly build apps that look amazing both on iOS and Android. Youâ€™ll be able to share lots of code between the two platforms and focus on making UI appealing to the user! Moreover, you can build a backend in Kotlin that will complement your KMM app and make it even more sustainable. 
 
Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time researching on KMP, struggling through gradle files and dependencies, building apps for work and for myself and would love to share my experience with everyone else whoâ€™s interested.
 
So stock up with pizza ingredients and letâ€™s explore the exciting world of KMP together! ðŸ¤“
